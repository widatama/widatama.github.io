It provides services to enable everyone to sell and buy products from all over Indonesia. As a Front-end Engineer, I was involved in many projects related to Bukalapak’s main website. Some of the notable projects are</p><ul class="list-disc leading-normal mb-2 text-xl"><li>Developed many of the early features of the main website, such as product search, shopping cart, transaction, and user dashboards.</li><li>Developed front-end component libraries for the website, first with only <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
 and <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr> and then later with Vue. This aided in the standardization of the website’s design and improved front-end development speed.</li><li>Migrated front-end asset processing from Rails pipeline to Webpack. This helped modernize the front-end stack and improve development productivity.</li><li>Migrated many website pages from server rendered into web application with <abbr title="Representational State Transfer">REST</abbr> <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>. This contributed to the back-end’s adoption of <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> architecture and, later, microservices.</li><li>Developed many internal tools that are used company-wide, such as a <abbr title="Representational State Transfer">REST</abbr> <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> client, component libraries, and middlewares for front-end servers. This improved other front-end engineers’ work speed since they could focus more on building product features.</li><li>Developed the infrastructure for distributed front-ends (microfrontends). This includes defining the protocol, developing the back-end layer, page compositor, page renderer, and the core services that coordinate other front-end services to work together. Distributed front-ends improved team productivity because it enabled different teams to work more independently without affecting each other too much. It also improved service operations by making the deployment scope smaller. Smaller deployment scope means deployments are faster and less risky.</li></ul><h3 class="text-2xl leading-tight mt-10 mb-2">Bukalapak Product Search</h3><img src="product-search.png"/><h3 class="text-2xl leading-tight mt-10 mb-2">Bukalapak Admin Dashboard</h3><img src="admin_dashboard.png"/><h3 class="text-2xl leading-tight mt-10 mb-2">Bukalapak Old Styleguide</h3><img class="mb-4" src="styleguide.png"/></div></article><nav class="wrap mx-auto flex justify-end mt-20 mb-28"><div class="flex justify-between text-xl md:w-full w-9/12"><div></div><div class="text-right"><a class="transition-colors duration-400 ease-in block my-4 hover:text-blue" href="/works/hijup/" title="HijUp">next</a></div></div></nav></body></html>
