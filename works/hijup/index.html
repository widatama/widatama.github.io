Started back in 2011, now it has grown to host more than fifty brands and serving many customers from around the world.</p><p class="leading-normal mb-2 text-xl">I was the only front-end engineer for HijUp from 2012 to 2014. As we were a small team, I was also taking care of the information architecture, user experience design, and a little part of the visual design.</p><p class="leading-normal mb-2 text-xl">HijUp was doing a major rewrite in 2013. We had a hope that HijUp will grow even bigger, so for this rewrite we were trying to make the code base well structured in addition to just piling up features. This includes separating the user interface and code for buyer website and administrator dashboard, using component based approach for stylesheet, and implementing module based javascript. We believed that this would make maintenance and adding new features easier in the future. After working for a few months we could say that we were quite successful. The website ran smoothly and the development experience was quite enjoyable.</p><h3 class="text-2xl leading-tight mt-6 mb-2">HijUp Product Page</h3><img class="mb-4" src="product-page.png" title="Hijup Product Page" alt="Product page"/><h3 class="text-2xl leading-tight mt-6 mb-2">HijUp Shopping Cart</h3><img class="mb-4" src="shopping-cart.png" title="Hijup Shopping Cart" alt="Shopping cart"/><h3 class="text-2xl leading-tight mt-6 mb-2">HijUp Mobile Site</h3><img class="mb-4" src="mobile.png" title="Hijup Mobile" alt="Mobile version"/><h3 class="text-2xl leading-tight mt-6 mb-2">HijUp Admin Dashboard</h3><img class="mb-4" src="layout.png" title="Hijup Admin Dashboard" alt="Admin dashboard layout"/><img class="mb-4" src="form.png" title="Hijup Admin Dashboard" alt="Admin dashboard form"/><img class="mb-4" src="data.png" title="Hijup Admin Dashboard" alt="Admin dashboard data tables"/><img class="mb-4" src="product-set.png" title="Hijup Admin Dashboard" alt="Admin dashboard product set"/></div></article><nav class="wrap mx-auto flex justify-end mt-20 mb-28"><div class="flex justify-between text-xl md:w-full w-9/12"><div><a class="transition-colors duration-400 ease-in block my-4 hover:text-blue" href="/works/bukalapak/" title="Bukalapak">◀ previous</a></div><div class="text-right"><a class="transition-colors duration-400 ease-in block my-4 hover:text-blue" href="/works/guess-the-number/" title="Guess the Number">next ▶</a></div></div></nav></body></html>
