<p>When you have nothing, you don’t fear being torn to shreds by the mob. You stand up and you call bullshit when you see it. But then when you start to do well… when you start to make a name for yourself… when you start to make money or have a certain number of Twitter followers, the spotlight turns to you.</p>
<p>You start to be more diplomatic and politically correct. You start to mould yourself into the shape of what everyone else expects you to be, because if you aren’t that, then the mob is waiting like it’s Lord of The fucking Flies.</p>
<p>Electric fences start to pop up all around you. Issues which you don’t even go near because touching them, in any way, is fatal. You can’t talk about sexism any more, because one wrong move there is career-ending. You don’t call out the bullshit industry awards, because you’re nominated to win some of them. You fail to draw attention to the morally bankrupt venture capitalists and journalists, because then they might not write about you or give you money any more.</p>
<p>So you mellow. And slowly but surely you turn into the very thing that you once rebelled against so strongly in your first album. When you had a voice. When you actually fucking stood for something.</p>
<p>And then you can’t talk about anything any more. The fear has taken over. All hope of the change that you once so strongly believed in has now been lost.</p>
<p><strong>The price of success is censorship. We bring it on ourselves, <br/> and we enforce it on others with this giant pyramid scheme <br/> which we call “life”.</strong></p>
<p>…</p>
<p><strong>The price of success is this: You have two choices. Join the bullshit facade and plod along as another sheep in the capitalist machine, doing whatever it takes to maintain your position — or stand up for something you believe in, and accept every kick, punch and vicious attack on who you are.</strong></p>
