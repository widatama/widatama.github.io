<blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ll tell you why. It&#8217;s because Watterson understood so much about the world. And not only was he able to understand so much, but he was able to present it in a way that made sense to everyone. He was teaching you, without you even noticing he was teaching you. And his medium for teaching was so incredibly brilliant and subtle, that I would bet most people didn&#8217;t appreciate how brilliant it was.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that Hobbes is completely and entirely a figment of Calvin&#8217;s imagination. He wasn&#8217;t like, magically alive in this alternate fantasy universe; Calvin exists here, in the same world that you and I live in. Watterson didn&#8217;t treat this like any other &#8216;imaginary friend&#8217; relationship either, he used it as a way to illustrate the thought process that we go through without even noticing.</p>
<p>When Calvin is speaking to Hobbes, he&#8217;s speaking to himself. When Hobbes responds to Calvin, it is Calvin thinking of ideas and being creative. Hobbes has his own personality and it is actually the personality of the inner-Calvin. And Watterson is incredibly consistent with this, he never deviates from this relationship. He never gives Hobbes ideas or responses that wouldn&#8217;t be natural for Calvin to make. A regular Calvin &amp; Hobbes discussion follows the same pattern as thought development in your own head.</p>
<p>Calvin is an implementation of Bill Watterson himself, thinking of ideas and making reflections on the world, but Watterson used the medium of cartoons to write his ideas. He came up with an ingenious method for illustrating his own inner-self battling with the ideas that the world gives to him. For that, I would argue that Watterson is one of the greatest psychologists of all time. He not only understood how the brain and thought work, but he came up with a metaphor for the process that would allow him to literally illustrate his thoughts. And his thoughts make me jealous of how brilliant he is. You read his stuff, and he has ideas about everything, he is an artistic thinker. I think of Contact and the line &#8216;so beautiful&hellip; there are no words&hellip; they should&#8217;ve sent a poet&#8217;. Watterson is that poet. He is the man who is able to take thoughts that are difficult for people to describe, and put words/pictures to them. It&#8217;s much easier to illustrate inner-conflict and idea development if you have two characters acting out the two sides of an idea, as well as how ideas progress and come to be. Imagine Watterson was just like other philosophers/thinkers and wrote a big heavy book about what he thinks of life, politics, relationships, science, etc. No one would read that, but millions of people read his comics.</p>
<p>I clued into all of this during my reading of the series, which I read all of in just a month back in the fall. I had never read them before, and I couldn&#8217;t stop. This concept that Watterson created was made apparent to me after reading a bunch of the &#8216;death by wagon ride&#8217; strips. In these strips (of which there are many), Calvin and Hobbes are riding through near death and neither of them are scared, excited, or otherwise phased at all. But, the entire ride, Calvin is making a monologue about some idea that just occurred to him. Hobbes, being Calvin&#8217;s inner-self, is completely unphased by the ride because he&#8217;s focusing on the ideas Calvin is creating. He should be flipping out and yelling at Calvin to slow down, but instead, he&#8217;s just patiently listening to what Calvin has to say. Just as our subconscious would.</p>
<p>There are so many other great details about this relationship that Watterson makes. Such as Calvin leaving Hobbes at home whenever he goes to school. Along with the many comments Calvin makes about the poor quality of education he&#8217;s getting, he also leaves Hobbes, his intelligent and helpful side, at home. The American education is so factually based that he has no need to bring the part of his brain that helps form new ideas with him to school. There&#8217;s no need for Calvin to think critically, the school doesn&#8217;t demand it of him. But I guarantee that most readers noticed the difference between at-home Calvin and in-school Calvin. Outside school, he&#8217;s making dramatic and insightful ideas about life, science, politics, etc., but in school, it&#8217;s just snarky and sarcastic Calvin that just talks about how his education is failing him. And they probably wondered how Calvin can be so smart at home, but can&#8217;t do well in school. It&#8217;s because Calvin leaves his critically thinking brain at home.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also incredibly obvious with their handling of Susie, Calvin&#8217;s &#8216;love interest&#8217;. Calvin treats her like all prepubescent boys treat girls and their cooties. Hobbes, Calvin&#8217;s subconscious, is the only one that notices how nice, pretty, and awesome Susie is. When I was a kid, I was a shit to other girls, but I recognized in the back of my mind when I liked a girl. That&#8217;s my Hobbes, taunting me about how much I actually like her. Hobbes doesn&#8217;t just happen to like Susie and think she&#8217;s cute when Calvin is a bitch to her, the two go hand in hand.</p>
<p>Hobbes will often act as the moral, safe, and responsible side of Calvin too. All of us have a subconscious telling us when something looks dangerous as fuck, or would result in other people getting hurt, some people just don&#8217;t listen to it.</p>
<p>There are also two other important components of C&amp;H&#8217;s world-wide love, both are much, much easier to notice. First is Watterson&#8217;s treatment of IP and respect for his fans as well as the integrity of his creation. He wrote these strips everyday for ten years, and when he thought he was getting close to repeating ideas or using ideas of lesser quality, he stopped writing. He didn&#8217;t dilute his creation, he kept it A-list, which is how it will always be remembered. And the other point, is that they were relatable, which is even more mind-bogglingly genius. Watterson managed to create a metaphor for human thought that can be related to everyone&#8217;s childhood? Goddammit, how!?! Everyone remembers not wanting to wake up for school. Everyone remembers wishing for snow days. Everyone remembers having bad days and wanting to kill everyone. Everyone remembers going places and doing things that they didn&#8217;t want to do. Everyone remembers questioning the stupid rules and seemingly ambiguous regulations that our parents gave us. All of us relate to Calvin, and by extension, Watterson.</p>
<p>Everything went right with Calvin and Hobbes; the art, the flow, the topics, the humor, everything. It was one of those one in a million gems that you see just a couple of times in your life. Nothing is perfect, but Calvin and Hobbes was as close to perfect as I can imagine.</p>
