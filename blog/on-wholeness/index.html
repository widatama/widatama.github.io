<p>I actually attack the concept of happiness. The idea that&mdash;I don&#8217;t mind people being happy&mdash;but the idea that everything we do is part of the pursuit of happiness seems to me a really dangerous idea and has led to a contemporary disease in Western society, which is fear of sadness. It&#8217;s a really odd thing that we&#8217;re now seeing people saying &#8220;write down 3 things that made you happy today before you go to sleep&#8221;, and &#8220;cheer up&#8221; and &#8220;happiness is our birthright&#8221; and so on. We&#8217;re kind of teaching our kids that happiness is the default position&mdash;it&#8217;s rubbish. Wholeness is what we ought to be striving for and part of that is sadness, disappointment, frustration, failure; all of those things which make us who we are. Happiness and victory and fulfillment are nice little things that also happen to us, but they don&#8217;t teach us much. Everyone says we grow through pain and then as soon as they experience pain they say &#8220;Quick! Move on! Cheer up!&#8221; I&#8217;d like just for a year to have a moratorium on the word &#8220;happiness&#8221; and to replace it with the word &#8220;wholeness&#8221;. <br/>Ask yourself &#8220;is this contributing to my wholeness?&#8221; and if you&#8217;re having a bad day, it is.</p>
